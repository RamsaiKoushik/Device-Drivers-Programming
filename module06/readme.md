# Read-Write Lock (`rwlock_t`) in Character Driver

This README focuses on the use of **read-write lock (`rwlock_t`)** in a simple RAM-backed Linux character device driver. Other mechanisms like mutex, semaphore, and spinlock are already covered separately.

## Files in the Folder
- `module06.c` ‚Äì Character driver source code (uses `rwlock_t`)
- `app.c` ‚Äì User-space test application (reused from previous tests)
- `Makefile` ‚Äì Standard Makefile to build the driver

## üõ†Ô∏è Syntax and Use-Cases

### üîπ Basic Initialization
```c
rwlock_t my_lock;
rwlock_init(&my_lock);
```

### üîπ Locking Variants

| Function                    | Type           | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `read_lock()`               | Blocking       | Acquires read lock (allows multiple readers)          |
| `read_unlock()`             | -              | Releases read lock                                    |
| `write_lock()`              | Blocking       | Acquires write lock (exclusive access)                |
| `write_unlock()`            | -              | Releases write lock                                   |
| `read_lock_irqsave(flags)` | Interrupt-safe | Acquires read lock and disables interrupts            |
| `read_unlock_irqrestore(flags)` | -         | Releases lock and restores interrupt state            |
| `write_lock_irqsave(flags)`| Interrupt-safe | Acquires write lock and disables interrupts           |
| `write_unlock_irqrestore(flags)`| -         | Releases lock and restores interrupt state            |

> ‚ö†Ô∏èUse IRQ-safe versions only if you're working in interrupt context or need atomicity w.r.t. interrupts.

## What is `rwlock_t`?

A `rwlock_t` is a kernel synchronization primitive that allows:

- **Multiple concurrent readers** (read_lock)
- **Only one writer at a time** (write_lock), and no readers during that write

This makes it more efficient in **read-heavy workloads** where contention on write is minimal.

---

## When to Use `rwlock_t`?

- Use when **frequent reads and rare writes** occur.
- Avoid in **write-heavy scenarios** as writers get blocked if readers keep coming in.
